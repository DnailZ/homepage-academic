However, today’s design of serverless computing platforms based on stateless short-lived functions leads to missed opportunities for modern runtimes to optimize serverless functions through techniques such as JIT compilation and code profiling.\nWe found that modern serverless platforms can not fully leverage language runtime optimizations: Modern serverless platforms can not share JIT-compiled code between different instances. From the picture, we noticed original serverless function can be accelerated by JIT code and profile sharing.\nWorking in progress: I\u0026rsquo;m trying to implement this on HotspotVM.

You can model many real-world structures in graphs: social networks, web documents … In most of the time, graphs are stored as sparse matrices. But in many real-world problems, sparse matrices are sometimes too large to fit into memory. We may use distributed strategy to resolve this problem. However, recent research has shown that the single machine disk-based method outperforms many distributed ones in many cases. But these disk-based graph processing systems still have a lot of IO overhead. To address this problem, we proposed a new graph task ordering algorithm that can reduce almost 50% of data loading from the disk.\nThe process of this algorithm is shown in this slides.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"e4ff07a0f991da960ad4312c36a3eb9a","permalink":"https://dnailz.github.io/homepage-academic/project/graph/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/homepage-academic/project/graph/","section":"project","summary":"This is a traditional work in graph processing systems.
